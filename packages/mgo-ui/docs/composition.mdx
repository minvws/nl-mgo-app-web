# Composition

<span className="intro">
    Use the `asChild` prop to compose functionality onto alternative element types or your own React
    components.
</span>

For composing different styles and behaviors across components, we chose to use the [Radix-UI Slot](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/utilities/slot) implementation. This approach drastically simplifies the type checking for components as types are not mixed together.

For example: when you wish to render an `<a>` with the styles of a `Button` component, you can use the `asChild` prop to compose the `Button` component onto the `<a>` element. Using the `asChild` prop will also pass down the `Button` component's props to the `<a>` element.

<span className="context">
> If you were to use [the _as_ prop](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/utilities/polymorphic), you would need allow `<a>` props on a `Button` component, which can get more complicated if you also wish to support the `<Link>` from `react-router-dom` for example.
> Using the `asChild` approach each component type will only need to type check their own props.
</span>

<Source
    language="html"
    code={`
<Button asChild>
    <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
</Button>

...

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

<Button asChild>
    <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
</Button>
`} />

For implementing this pattern there is a useful hook called [_useComposition_](/docs/hooks-usecomposition--docs)

It also makes it possible to compose multiple components together. For more information on using the `asChild` for composition please see the [Radix-UI documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/guides/composition).
