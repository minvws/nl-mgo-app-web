# Welcome to the MGO UI

Here you will find a collection of components and styles to use for your project.

<br />

## Prerequisites

The `@minvws/mgo-ui` uses the `@minvws/mgo-tailwind` [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) theme which is set up to match [the design](<https://www.figma.com/file/IGdxtARM9ssEvgRRMy5xxt/Mijn-Gezondheids-Overzicht-(realisatie)?type=design&node-id=344-3405&mode=design&t=GwMD9QoTBG2HNtWd-0>).
In order to use these components you will need to:

1. add the `@minvws/mgo-tailwind` theme to your project's tailwind config.
2. add both the `font.css` and `index.css`from `@minvws/mgo-tailwind` to your project.

<Source
    language="javascript"
    code={`
// tailwind.config.js
import theme from "@minvws/mgo-tailwind/theme/index.js";
\export default {
    theme,
    content: [ ... ],
};

`}
/>

Tailwind offers a great [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) which can read the config and help with highlighting / linting and autocompletion. We highly recommend you install this plugin.
There are a lot of utility helpers included which [are well documented](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).
You use the styles by simply applying the correcty utility class names to an element.

## Components

All components of the `mgo-ui` are available through the index.

<Source
    language="ts"
    code={`
import { Heading } from '@minvws/mgo-ui
`}
/>

All the available components are documented here with examples and controls which you can use to test them.
