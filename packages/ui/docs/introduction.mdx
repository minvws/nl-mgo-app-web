# Welcome to the MGO UI

Here you will find a collection of components and styles to use for your project.

<br />

## Prerequisites

The `@minvws/mgo-ui` uses the [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) theme which is set up to match [the design](<https://www.figma.com/file/IGdxtARM9ssEvgRRMy5xxt/Mijn-Gezondheids-Overzicht-(realisatie)?type=design&node-id=344-3405&mode=design&t=GwMD9QoTBG2HNtWd-0>).
In order to use these components you will need to add the `tailwind-theme` and `tailwind-source` to your project's tailwind css.

<Source
    language="css"
    code={`
@import "tailwindcss";
@import '@minvws/mgo-ui/tailwind-theme';
@import '@minvws/mgo-ui/tailwind-source';
`}
/>

Tailwind offers a great [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) which can read the config and help with highlighting / linting and autocompletion. We highly recommend you install this plugin.
There are a lot of utility helpers included which [are well documented](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).
You use the styles by simply applying the correct utility class names to an element.

## Components

All components of the `mgo-ui` are available through the index.

<Source
    language="ts"
    code={`
import { Heading } from '@minvws/mgo-ui
`}
/>

All the available components are documented here with examples and controls which you can use to test them.
