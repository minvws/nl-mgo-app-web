# Mijn Gezondheidsoverzicht (web)

This repository contains the "Mijn Gezondheidsoverzicht", or MGO, application and components. It is a monorepo which contains multiple individual apps and packages. To [learn more about the MGO app itself][mgo-about] please visit the `about` page.

## Directory structure

This repository is a monorepo in that all directories under `apps/*` and `packages/*` are condisered their own individual package and contain their own dependencies and scripts. Only a few things are organised at the root level, such as formatting and linting.

```shell
├── apps
│    └── mgo                # The main MGO application
│    └── mgo-e2e            # End-to-end tests for the mgo application
├── packages
│    ├── data-services      # HTTP client for making requests to data services

## Quick run

To run the MGO app locally there is a `docker-compose` configuration available. This is only meant for testing the application, **it is not to be used in production**. For actual development, we recommend you use the [Development][mgo-development] instructions instead. To run the MGO app locally using docker, ensure you have the latest [Docker (Desktop) installed][docker].

```sh
# Build and run a local test server using docker
docker compose up --build mgo
# Stop local test server
docker compose down
```

By default it will connect to the test environments, however this can be changed by adding a `.env` in the `apps/mgo-e2e` directory. You can copy the `.env.example` for some default values.

> After changing `.env` values you will have to **rebuild** and **restart** the container. (Rerun the first command above)

## Scripts

Once you have a [local development environment][mgo-development]] set up, there are several `pnpm` scripts you can run from this root directory. To run a command, open a new terminal from this root directory and enter the following command:

```bash
pnpm run <command>
```

| Command           | Description                                                                                          |

## NX

We have started using [nx] for managing processing within this monorepo such as building, typechecking or linting. We also use nx to publish certain packages. See the `nx.json` for details.

You can use [nx] to run certain tasks for projects or viewing a graph of the entire monorepo. Running a command for a specific project:

```bash
npx nx run <project>:<command>
```

Some commonly used [nx commands][nx-commands] and examples

| Command                                | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm exec nx graph`                   | [Graph dependencies within workspace][nx-graph]                  |
| `pnpm exec nx run mgo:build`           | Create a production build for the mgo app                        |
| `pnpm exec nx run mgo:dev`             | Start a development server for the mgo app                       |
| `pnpm exec nx run mgo:typecheck`       | Check the types for the mgo app (and its dependencies)           |
| `pnpm exec nx run mgo-utils:typecheck` | Check the types for the mgo utils package (and its dependencies) |
| `pnpm exec nx show project mgo-utils`  | Check the types for the mgo utils package (and its dependencies) |

We also use nx to publish certain packages to [NPM]. For more information on this please [visit the NPM packages documentation][mgo-npm-packages]]
